Hello and welcome to my github page. I am Nicholas Moore a recent computer science graduate from University of Houston. 
This github page is currently under construction as I work on sorting out my personal and college projects and push them here with documentation.
I will also be creating a personal/portfolio website to be hosted here via github pages.

After graduating college I had taken a vacation to spend time with my family which I was unable to do while growing up. As such I have not spent time working on
this till May 1, 2022. If you are viewing this before then I hope for your understanding.
